# Capstone-Project

A team consisting of two LAU students majoring in Computer Science decided to work on an e-commerce website regarding the capstone project. A website that can sell different products including cellphones, consoles and many others. 

  

On the first of July 2022, our team members started developing the project specifications and requirements to understand and start working on them. 

  

At first, due to what Lebanon is facing, at the level of health and gasoline issues, our team members faced issues in a direct meeting to discuss the project specifications. Although, this has resulted in time issues that affected the product development and project delivery time.   

  

“Newbie Gamers” is a website that consists of a home page, which the user will be directed to after signing up (entering his/her personal information) to have an account on the website. The home Page will introduce the user to all that this shop offers including products, information about the shop, and others. This website also includes a shop page, listing all products that are in the shop, the user can easily read brief information about every single item, other than the ease in adding them to the favorite page if the user like this product or adding them to the basket page if the user wants this product. This shop page includes also filters that help the user to find a certain product he/she wants. A repair page is also found which is a page that helps customers set an appointment (by a calendar) for a certain repair of an item. Moving on to the contact us page includes ways of letting the customer know how to contact the shop, either by email, phone number, or location. Adding the ability of adding comments and thoughts regarding the website or shop in general. About us page that introduces the shop history and some statistics. Finally, a profile page shows the signed-in user's personal information, able to edit it or even change the password. This page also includes information regarding his shopping status, whether he added some item in the add to favorite or basket page, he/she can easily see what he/she added previously. 

  

“Newbie Gamers” was not only developed for user use only but also, this website enabled the shop customers to enter the website by using the admin user that is defined by the shop or company. The admin enters the website by pressing the log-in button and entering the correct admin registering requirements (username and password). The admin has different pages and functionalities. To start, a dashboard page is the starter page, the admin will be directed to it directly after signing in, which includes charts of profit, for example, different tables showing the customers, products, offers, admin accounts, appointments and many others. The admin can see admin accounts, add them and remove them. The admin can add a certain product or remove them, along with the ability to add new types or categories. Furthermore, the admin can change the working status regarding any repairment for a customer, where it can be set to pending if the work is not done yet or work of the requirement is done. Discount offers can be added also. Noting that on every page there are some statistical charts that help the admin to know what is happening in his shop including profits, losses, from what location our customers are more based, loyal customers, which products are more to be sold and which are more not to be sold and many others. 

  

Finally, we are excited to begin the implementation part of all the specifications and requirements of the system. In this part, we will be using MySQL and Virtual Studio Code. Our team members are hoping and willing that our website will meet what they thought previously.
